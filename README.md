# Discrete Scroll

It needs to be run each time you boot. If you want this to be automatic you may
go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items` and add
`DiscreteScroll` to the list. If you want to undo the effect you may launch
Activity Monitor, search for `DiscreteScroll` and force it to quit.
